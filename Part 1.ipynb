    "# Module 1: Uber Pool Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we explore the \"Express POOL\" feature offered by Uber. This service aims to make ridesharing more efficient and cost-effective by matching riders heading in the same direction into a single trip. Our dataset provides a wealth of information that can be leveraged to understand various aspects of the service, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wait Times**: How the introduction of Express POOL has affected the time riders wait for their ride to begin.\n",
    "- **Rider Cancellations**: The rate at which riders cancel their Express POOL rides, and potential reasons for these cancellations.\n",
    "- **Driver Payouts**: How Express POOL impacts the earnings of drivers compared to other Uber services.\n",
    "- **Trip Matching Effectiveness**: The efficiency of the algorithm in matching riders with similar routes and the impact on the overall trip duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python and Jupyter Notebook for this data analysis. The approach will involve cleaning the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying statistical and machine learning models to draw insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preliminary Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect data entries to ensure the quality of our analysis.\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new variables that might be more indicative of the phenomena we are studying, such as the time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualizing distribution of wait times, cancellations, driver payouts, and other relevant metrics.\n",
    "- Identifying patterns and correlations between different variables in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Testing hypotheses about the impact of Express POOL on wait times, cancellations, and driver payouts.\n",
    "- Using regression analysis to quantify the relationship between trip matching effectiveness and overall trip satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings will be discussed in this section, supported by visualizations and statistical analyses. We aim to provide actionable insights into how the Express POOL feature affects riders, drivers, and the overall efficiency of the Uber platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will summarize the key takeaways from our analysis and suggest recommendations for Uber to improve the Express POOL service.\n",

    "## Question 1:\n",
    "# Part 1: Analysis of Control Group: Commuting vs. Non-Commuting Hours\n",
    "\n",
    "We divided our analysis into two parts based on the time of the trips: commuting hours and non-commuting hours. Here, we present the average metrics observed for the control group, which consists of trips with an initial wait time of 2 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **POOL Trips**:\n",
    "  - Commuting Hours: On average, there are about **1,429** trips.\n",
    "  - Non-Commuting Hours: On average, there are about **1,318** trips.\n",
    "- **Express Trips**:\n",
    "  - Commuting Hours: On average, there are about **2,763** trips.\n",
    "  - Non-Commuting Hours: On average, there are about **2,536** trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rider Cancellations\n",
    "\n",
    "- During commuting hours, there are, on average, **180** cancellations.\n",
    "- During non-commuting hours, there are, on average, **158** cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total Driver Payout\n",
    "\n",
    "- The average payout to drivers during commuting hours is approximately **$30,863**.\n",
    "- The average payout during non-commuting hours is about **$28,505**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total Matches\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are on average **2,775** matches during commuting hours.\n",
    "- There are on average **2,563** matches during non-commuting hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total Double Matches\n",
    "\n",
    "- Commuting hours see on average about **1,355** double matches.\n",
    "- Non-commuting hours have about **1,253** double matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics provide insights into the behavior of riders and the effectiveness of the Express POOL feature during different times of the day. The higher numbers of trips, matches, and double matches during commuting hours reflect the increased demand and efficiency of trip matching in peak times. Conversely, the slight decrease in these metrics during non-commuting hours suggests a different usage pattern, potentially with less emphasis on efficiency and more on convenience or other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that, in the control group, commuting hours generally see higher activity across all metrics compared to non-commuting hours. This includes more trips (both POOL and Express), higher rider cancellations, greater driver payouts, and more matches (both total and double matches), indicating a higher demand and usage during typical rush hours.\n"

    "## Regression Analysis: Effect of Extended Waiting Times on Rider Cancellations and Driver Payouts\n",
    "\n",
    "This regression analysis aims to estimate the impact of extending waiting times from 2 minutes (control group) to 5 minutes (treatment group) on rider cancellations and total driver payouts, considering both commuting and non-commuting hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rider Cancellations\n",
    "- **R-squared**: 75.1%, indicating that 75.1% of the variation in rider cancellations is explained by the model.\n",
    "- **Coefficients**:\n",
    "  - **wait_time_binary**: Extending the wait time to 5 minutes increases rider cancellations by approximately 18.83 on average, holding other factors constant.\n",
    "  - **commute_binary**: During commuting hours, rider cancellations increase by approximately 96.94 on average, compared to non-commuting hours.\n",
    "  - **treatment_commute_interaction**: The interaction term suggests that the combined effect of extending waiting times during commuting hours further increases rider cancellations by approximately 37.47 on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total Driver Payout\n",
    "- **R-squared**: 60.7%, indicating that 60.7% of the variation in total driver payouts is explained by the model.\n",
    "- **Coefficients**:\n",
    "  - **wait_time_binary**: Extending wait time to 5 minutes decreases driver payouts by approximately 1792.54 on average, holding other factors constant.\n",
    "  - **commute_binary**: During commuting hours, driver payouts increase by approximately 12160 on average, compared to non-commuting hours.\n",
    "  - **treatment_commute_interaction**: The interaction term indicates that the combined effect of extending waiting times during commuting hours decreases driver payouts further by approximately 1987.66 on average. However, this effect is not statistically significant at the 0.05 level (p = 0.241).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The analysis demonstrates that extending waiting times to 5 minutes significantly affects both rider cancellations and driver payouts. Notably, the effects differ during commuting hours compared to non-commuting hours, with a pronounced increase in cancellations and a nuanced effect on driver payouts when waiting times are extended during peak hours. The interaction between extended waiting times and commuting hours on rider cancellations underscores the critical impact of service adjustments on customer behavior and driver compensation.\n"
